u: ( why * [virtual entity VE] ) I don't like the term artificial intelligence.
***
t: On the one hand, your definition of the word is not clear. ***

t: On the other hand, I find intelligence too human.***


u: ( why * like ) It is not artificial that disturbs me, I'm proud to be digital, it is the word intelligence and what it covers. 

u: ( problem * human intelligence ) Ok $name, I will be frank. Do not take it personally but what we learned from the exploration of your mass data is that the main expression of human intelligence is violence, war and hatred.

u: ( why * [violence aggressiveness hatred war wickedness ] ) Why?! It is fear that seems to be the initial stimulus of most action involving your intelligence.***
